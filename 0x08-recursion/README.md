At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

GeneralWhat is recursionHow to implement recursionIn what situations you should implement recursionIn what situations you shouldn’t implement recursionCopyright - PlagiarismYou are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.RequirementsGeneralAllowed editors: vi, vim, emacsAll your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89All your files should end with a new lineA README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatoryYour code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.plYou are not allowed to use global variablesNo more than 5 functions per fileYou are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbiddenYou are allowed to use _putcharYou don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into accountIn the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examplesThe prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.hDon’t forget to push your header fileYou are not allowed to use any kind of loopsYou are not allowed to use static variables
